V3
Task: Language Identification
Note: training and testing list file is not fixed, can be changed to anything (e.g., open speaker, open vocabulary, and different type of noise background)

bash run.sh experiment_name train_list test_list > memo/memo_experiment_ID.txt
or more examples are in the script master_run.sh.

Note: 
run.sh contains training and testing 
add_run.sh only contains testing part (save time)

All the useful information will be saved in the directory /results/
